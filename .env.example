# Fit-O-Charity Chatbot - Environment Variables
# Copy this file to .env and add your values

# Gemini API Key (required for AI functionality)
# Get your key from: https://aistudio.google.com/apikey
VITE_GEMINI_API_KEY=your_gemini_api_key_here

# Note: For local development, you can also set the API key
# directly in the Admin panel. The Admin panel key takes 
# precedence over this environment variable.
#
# For production hosting (Vercel, Netlify, etc.):
# 1. Set VITE_GEMINI_API_KEY as an environment variable in your hosting platform
# 2. This keeps your API key secure and not exposed in the client-side code
